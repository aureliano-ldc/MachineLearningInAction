间隔（margin）：训练数据集中所有样本点与分离超平面距离最小值
支持向量（support vector）：与分离超平面距离最近的样本点实例
We’d like to find the point closest to the separating hyperplane and make sure 
this is as far away from the separating line as possible. This is known as margin.
The points closest to the separating hyperplane are known as support vectors.
